A web blog & portfolio designed to track html, css and javascript progress whilst documenting personal growth as a web developer.

I've always enjoyed writing and have kept journals since I was a little kid. As a teen and adult, I've written informally for college magazines and on Facebook, documenting the often amusing interactions ecountered whilst riding a bus or your losing keys in Home Depot. With the goal of eventually becoming a fullstack web developer, I thought that working on a personal project would be a great way to learn, grow and monitor progress.

Currently documenting my time at the University of Washington's coding bootcamp, I will continue this project after graduation. I'd like to build this space to eventually hold the following (but not limited to): Blog Porfolio Contact About Me Learning (links to information I've found useful or coleagues projects that myself or anyone- else can reference) Any edits, tips, critiques or suggestions are welcome and will be greatly appreciated.

Cheers!
