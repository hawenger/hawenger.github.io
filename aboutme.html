                <p>Dedicated to arts and technology, nothing puts a bigger smile on my face than writing and debugging blocks of code. I love improving upon processes as well as working with a team to bring creative visions to life.</p>
                <p>A skilled writer with radio copy-write experience, .this, in combination with a love of languages, born from my attendance to a spanish immersion school, makes staying up to date on the latest syntax a passionate endeavor. In fact, my
                    both my love & passion for what I do means I'm incredibly self-motivated to learn and grow as a programmer.</p>

                <p>Born in Louisville, KY & raised on the outskirts of Columbus, OH, I've lived in a number of cities across the country including Salt Lake City, UT and Seattle, WA. My varied work background has given me insight into the challenges businesses
                    face when dealing with high traffic websites and a diverse clientele.</p>
                <p>Most recently, I had the honor of working in the docket of Pierce County Superior Court's Clerk's Office in Tacoma, WA. This was especially eye-opening in terms of identifying obstacles people can face when integrating newer technology
                    into older systems.</p>

                <p>JavaScript is my language of choice however, I'm always excited by the prospect of learning new languages and am currently studying Java during my down time.</p>
                <p>Concerned with website accessibility as our population continues to age, I love collaborating on new ideas and brainstorming ways in which to not only grow technology with generations but also how to introduce new ideas to those who may
                    be less tech savvy.</p>
